# To-Do List Application  

A simple graphical To-Do List application built using Python's **Tkinter** library. This application allows users to add, view, and delete tasks, with data persistence through a text file.

## Features  
- Add tasks to the list.  
- View tasks in a scrollable listbox.  
- Delete tasks from the list.  
- Tasks are saved persistently in a `tasklist.txt` file.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter (pre-installed with Python on most systems)  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git  
   cd <your-repo-name>  
   ```  
2. Ensure that the required images (`task.png`, `topbar.png`, `dock.png`, `delete.png`) are placed in the directory specified in the code or update the file paths accordingly.  

3. Run the script:  
   ```bash  
   python todo_list.py  
   ```  

## File Structure  
- **todo_list.py**: The main script containing the application logic.  
- **tasklist.txt**: A text file to store the tasks persistently. This file will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.  
- **Images Folder**: Contains the required images (`task.png`, `topbar.png`, `dock.png`, `delete.png`).  

## Usage  
1. Enter a task in the input field and click **ADD** to add it to the list.  
2. Select a task and click the **delete button** (trash icon) to remove it from the list.  
3. All tasks are saved to `tasklist.txt` and loaded automatically on reopening the application.
